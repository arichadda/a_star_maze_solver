### A* Maze Solver

### Introduction:

This repo contains an implementation of A* search which used heuristics to traverse a maze and find the optimal path. In my implementation of A*, in addition to the  null heuristic, I also included the use of the Manhattan distance heuristic and the Euclidian distance heuristic. The A-star search successfully handled both the standard maze problem with multiple robots and the sensorless robot problem. 

To run my code please go to either `test_mazeworld.py` or `test_sensorless.py` uncomment one of the tests and run.
